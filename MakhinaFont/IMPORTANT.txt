Is my second attempt on typefaces. I don't have much experience yet, but this time I tried something more functional, simple, regular and not so original than my previous one. Inspired in Gas Pipes, the basic shape is a rounded square.

You can experiment, share, talk, use it, but give me always credit, don't redistribute or present it as your own. Thank you!

Thanks goes to FERNANDO VALE who teached me everything and helped me again, MARCO GONÇALVES, MÁRCIO LOBO and CARLA RIBEIRO who always had the patient to give me some feedback.
